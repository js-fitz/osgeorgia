- **2020 November election results** — https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/105369/web.264614/#/access-to-races
    - (click on the caret icon next to a county, then "Detail TXT" to trigger download)
    - These numbers are changing as counties further certify vote counts. The scraper takes about 2 hours to run so I am aiming to update this weekly, roughly.
